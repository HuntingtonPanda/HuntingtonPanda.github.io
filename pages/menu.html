            Horchata is a refreshing and creamy drink that is popular in Latin America, 
            Spain, and some parts of the United States. It is made from ground almonds 
            or rice, water, sugar, and cinnamon, and sometimes includes other ingredients 
            like vanilla or lime zest. The mixture is blended and strained to create a 
            smooth and creamy beverage that is served cold over ice. Horchata has a sweet 
            and nutty flavor, with a hint of cinnamon which makes it perfect for those hot 
            California days.
